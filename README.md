# ova_ai_test

I went for a solution that made much more sense to me than just having a list and used a bigger concept that are products and not just groceries items.
The test took me about 8 hours to do. Keep in mind that i had not touched this stack in the last 7 months or so.

Since i added a lot of features that were not asked for, i did not add some tests for the backend because it would have taken quite a lot of time.

TO GET STARTED : 

You will need to have node and npm downloaded on your local machine.
For the persistance, i'm using a mongo database, so you will need that as well.

1. Clone the project.
2. Open 2 command prompt.
3. Make sure that you don't have anything running on port 3000 and 5173
4. CD into Server with one cmd prompt and CD into Client with the other one.
5. Run npm i on both command prompt.
6. Run npm run dev on both command prompt
7. Make a GET request to http://localhost:3000/db/seed if you want to have some seeds
8. Go to the command prompt on the client cd and click on the given link to open the vue app
